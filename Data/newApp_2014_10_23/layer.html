                <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city 
                    in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million

                <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for 
                    two 
                    millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who 
                    named 
                    it Londinium.</p>
